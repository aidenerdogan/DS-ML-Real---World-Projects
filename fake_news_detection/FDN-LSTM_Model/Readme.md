# Fake News Detection with RNN(LSTM) Neural Network ModelIn this part of Fake |News Dtection project we will predict fake news with RNN(LSTM) Neural Network Model model. Before going ahead in this project, get aware of thesome Machine Learning terminologies related to it like fake news,Nural Network, RNN, LSTM## What is the Neural NetworkArtificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. ## What is the RNNHumans don’t start their thinking from scratch every second. As you read this essay, you understand each word based on your understanding of previous words. You don’t throw everything away and start thinking from scratch again. Your thoughts have persistence.Traditional neural networks can’t do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming. For example, imagine you want to classify what kind of event is happening at every point in a movie. It’s unclear how a traditional neural network could use its reasoning about previous events in the film to inform later ones.Recurrent neural networks address this issue. They are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist.![alt text](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/RNN-rolled.png)## What is the LSTMLong Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.1 They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!All recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer.### RNN![alt text](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-SimpleRNN.png)### LSTM![alt text](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-chain.png)## The DatasetAcknowledgementsAhmed H, Traore I, Saad S. “Detecting opinion spams and fake news using text classification”, Journal of Security and Privacy, Volume 1, Issue 1, Wiley, January/February 2018.Ahmed H, Traore I, Saad S.
