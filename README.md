## Bike Sharing Trip Generation and Analysis

This project aimed to address the absence of trip data for the popular Chicago Bike sharing service, Divvy. By capturing regular snapshots of station and bike availability, a custom algorithm was developed to generate trip data. The generated data underwent thorough data wrangling, and the exciting part was analyzing and visualizing the trips on interactive folium maps. This project successfully enabled the exploration of bike movements and user patterns within the Divvy system.

## Customer Segmentation with KNN and RFM

This project aimed to segment customers using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. By combining these techniques, the project successfully grouped customers based on their similarities and behavior patterns. This segmentation approach allowed businesses to personalize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

# Efficient Supply Allocation on Ride Hailing Platform
This task focuses on addressing the challenge of efficient supply allocation on a ride-hailing platform. The goal is to optimize the matching of drivers with rider demand in real-time. By analyzing a dataset of synthetic ride demand data, we aim to propose a solution and build a baseline model. The project also involves designing and deploying the model, communicating recommendations to drivers, and outlining an experiment to validate the solution for live operations. Through this project, we demonstrate expertise in data science fundamentals and product thinking, aiming to enhance the overall performance of the ride-hailing platform.
