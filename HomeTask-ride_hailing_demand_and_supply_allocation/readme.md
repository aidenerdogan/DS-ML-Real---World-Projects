# Efficient Supply Allocation on Ride-Hailing Platform

- This project focuses on addressing the challenge of efficient supply allocation on a ride-hailing platform, specifically X_company. The success of the platform relies on effectively matching supply (drivers) with demand (riders) in real-time. To ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of supply and demand, particularly how demand changes over time and space.

- The task at hand involves exploring the provided dataset, proposing a solution to guide drivers towards areas with higher expected demand, and building a baseline model to implement this solution. Additionally, the project requires documenting the model's design and deployment process, as well as outlining how model recommendations would be communicated to drivers.

- To accomplish these objectives, the first step is to analyze the dataset, which consists of synthetic ride demand data resembling real-life situations in the city of Tallinn. The dataset includes information such as the order's start time, latitude and longitude of the pick-up and destination points, and the monetary value of each ride.

- In order to improve the supply allocation process, additional data may be considered. The specific additional data requirements would depend on the solution proposed, but potential useful data could include historical demand patterns, traffic data, weather conditions, events, and public transportation schedules. References to relevant sources, if any, should be cited when incorporating such additional data into the solution.

- The project also emphasizes the design and deployment aspects of the model. This involves carefully considering the marketplace specifics and designing an experiment to validate the solution for live operations. The experiment design should take into account factors such as driver response, user feedback, and overall marketplace performance.

- Overall, this project aims to showcase fundamental data science skills and product thinking. By exploring the dataset, proposing a solution, building a baseline model, and outlining the design and deployment process, participants will demonstrate their abilities in understanding supply-demand dynamics, developing effective models, and considering practical aspects of implementing the solution on a ride-hailing platform.
