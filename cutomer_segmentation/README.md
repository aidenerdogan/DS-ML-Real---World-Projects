# Customer Segmentation using KNN and RFM

- The goal of this project was to perform customer segmentation using a combination of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and optimize customer engagement.

- To achieve this, the project utilized the KNN algorithm, a popular machine learning technique for classification and clustering. KNN works by assigning a customer to a segment based on the similarity of their attributes to those of the existing segments. By considering features such as purchase history, demographic information, and product preferences, KNN classified customers into segments that exhibited similar behaviors and characteristics.

- In addition to KNN, the project incorporated RFM analysis, which focuses on three key customer metrics: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Recency refers to the time since a customer's last purchase, frequency represents the number of purchases made within a specific period, and monetary value indicates the total amount spent by a customer. By calculating these metrics for each customer, RFM scores were assigned, enabling the identification of high-value, loyal, and potentially churned customers.

- The combination of KNN and RFM offered a powerful approach to customer segmentation. KNN leveraged the customer attributes to cluster similar customers together, while RFM provided valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and loyalty. By integrating these two techniques, the project enabled businesses to gain a comprehensive understanding of their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment.

- The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The performance of the segmentation model was assessed using evaluation metrics such as silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), depending on the specific requirements of the project.

- Overall, this project successfully employed KNN and RFM analysis for customer segmentation, allowing businesses to identify distinct customer groups and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. By understanding customer behaviors, preferences, and value, companies can improve customer satisfaction, retention, and ultimately drive business growth.
